## Quotify: Daily Bible Verse Inspiration

Quotify is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that delivers a random Bible verse to inspire and uplift you throughout the day.

### Features

- **Daily Dose of Scripture:** Displays a random Bible verse on page load.
- **Manual Refresh:** Clicking on the displayed verse fetches a new random verse.
- **Lightweight and Easy to Use:** No external dependencies needed.
- **Includes Bible Verses:** The `bible.txt` file provides a pre-populated set of verses.

### Inspired by Bible Verse Desktop

Just like desktop Bible verse software applications, Quotify aims to bring a daily dose of scripture directly to your web browser.

### Running the App

1. **Download the Files:**

   - Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Unzip the downloaded file (if needed).

2. **Open in Browser:**

   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The app will launch and display a random Bible verse.

### How it Works

Quotify uses JavaScript to fetch Bible verses from the included `bible.txt` file. The script parses the file, selects a random verse, and displays it on the webpage.

**Note:** This version does not include functionality for automatically fetching verses from an external source like an API.

### Customization

- You can modify the styling in the `style.css` file to change the app's appearance.
- You can edit the content within the `bible.txt` file to add, remove, or modify the Bible verses used in the app. Each verse should be on a separate line.
